This is the repository for my AP Research class. In it there is all data used, tests performed, and models created. In addition, there are histograms and boxplots based on the results of my experiments.

## Abstract

In my paper I explored the effects of using specialized neural network weight initialization, which I define as Xavier and He initialization. Using Python with Keras and Tensorflow I trained 900 networks between 3 different datasets of varying size and activation function. With that information I analyed the final weight distributions of the networks, and I pruned them to analyze their variety by approximating their graph edit distance. I found that networks initialized in a special manner have a higher variance in final weight but a lower structural variety.
